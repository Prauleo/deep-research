# Project Brief: Open Deep Research

## Core Purpose
An AI-powered research assistant that performs iterative, deep research on any topic by combining search engines, web scraping, and large language models.

## Primary Goals
1. Provide the simplest implementation of a deep research agent
2. Keep codebase small and maintainable (<500 LoC)
3. Create an easy-to-understand foundation that others can build upon
4. Enable iterative refinement of research direction over time
5. Support deep diving into topics through automated exploration

## Project Scope
- Focus on core research functionality
- Maintain simplicity and clarity in implementation
- Enable customization through environment variables and configuration
- Support both local and containerized deployment

## Success Metrics
1. Codebase remains under 500 lines of code
2. System successfully performs iterative research
3. Generates comprehensive, well-organized reports
4. Handles concurrent processing efficiently
5. Supports both breadth and depth in research exploration
